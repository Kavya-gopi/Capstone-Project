            <p>Online shopping has been known as a rapidly growing business, and although online grocery shopping has not followed these same growth patterns in the past, it is now being recognized for its potential. 
               The general consumer decision making process is characterized by a pre-decisional, a decisional and a post-decisional phase. All of which were addressed in an exploratory fashion, through a mixed methods strategy which combined both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection. One of the main results obtained through this study is the complementarity of retail channels - as it was found that online grocery shopping serves essentially for major shopping trips, being complemented with smaller trips to traditional stores.</p>
